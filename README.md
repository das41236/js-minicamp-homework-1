# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables : Contain specific pieces of information, or 'data'
	* Strings : A specific chain of characters that are interpreted between quotation marks.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) : A method of accepting an input, and manipulating said input to return a desired output. Commonly used to automate a repetitive task.
	* `if` statements : Programming statement that uses logic to check if certain conditions are met and outputs specific functions if said conditions are either true or false.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) : Works like an on/off switch. True works like on and false like off.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
